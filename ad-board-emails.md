# [ACTION NEEDED FROM ADVISORY BOARD] Please finilise votes to help us shape the agenda

We are excited to see the advisory board next month in Seattle! To help us 
ensure we bring the right topics to the discussion, we'd like to encourage 
you to do the following:

- Take a look at the general agenda for the day (https://github.com/rinpharma/rinpharma-summit-2024/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#agenda) and let us know if you have any questions
- We have 12 proposed topics in the discussion (https://github.com/rinpharma/rinpharma-summit-2024/discussions) please take a final look, and make sure to upvote the topics you would like to see when we move to the round table session. We'll use your votes to help prioritise what topics are carried through.

A really important role we lean on our advisory board for is also to capture the discussion. Many of our topics already have one volunteer, but 
if we plan to run any particularly popular round tables twice, we'd ideally have to moderators. As you do your final vote, please do consider what 
topics you'd like to place yourself in the centre of the discussion for, by taking on responsibility of facilating the discussion.

Please complete your final vote before the 18th (our next meeting).

BW, James, Katie, Phil and Harvey
